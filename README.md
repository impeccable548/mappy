# mappy🗺️ - Modern Map Explorer

Mappy is a simple, modern, web-based map application built with **Flask** for the backend and **Leaflet.js** for interactive mapping. It uses **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** via **Nominatim** for keyless location search and provides straight-line distance approximations for routing.

## ✨ Features

* **Interactive Map:** Powered by Leaflet and OpenStreetMap tiles.
* **Geolocation:** Automatically centers the map on the user's current location.
* **Location Search:** Uses the Nominatim API to find addresses and places.
* **Approximate Routing:** Calculates and displays estimated travel time and distance for walking, driving, and biking (straight-line distance).
* **Theme Toggle:** Supports both Light and Dark modes with preference persistence.
